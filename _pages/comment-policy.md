Written by **Disqus**. Refer the official comment policy [here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717097-comment-policy){:target="_blank"}.

This comment policy is a place for the author to set the tone of his/her community and lay a foundation for what is acceptable. They also provide a reference for making moderation decisions. If the author ever needs to ban a member or remove a comment, the author will be able to refer those members to the pre-determined community guidelines that they may have failed to follow.

## What to consider
When developing community guidelines, it is good to consider the type of community the author is trying to cultivate. Guidelines can cover topics like:
- **Etiquette -** "Be polite and stay on topic”. "No self-promotion". "Don't flag/downvote comments because you disagree with a user."
- **Expectations -** "Your comment will be removed for reason X, Y, and Z"
- **Privacy -** “Don’t post personal information"
- **Moderation Settings -** "Comments containing links are pre-moderated". "Discussions auto-close after 7 days".
- Anything else that you’d like members to keep in mind while commenting
