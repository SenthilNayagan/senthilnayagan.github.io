My name is Senthil Nayagan. I am a seasoned IT professional with 17 years of experience designing and building complex business solutions with open-source technologies. I've been working in the field of data engineering for the past few years. Simply said, I am a Data Engineer by profession, a Rustacean by interest, and an avid Content Creator.

It's my tech blog where I explore various data engineering concepts. Also covers design and coding principles to help you become a competent developer. I've worked to make all of my stories as clear as possible while yet providing enough detail for you to comprehend the ideas.

If you like my stories or have suggestions for their improvement, please feel free to contact me at [hello@senthilnayagan.com](mailto:hello@senthilnayagan.com).

Thank you for your support!
