# Introducing infrastructure as code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) refers to the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code rather than manual processes. When we talk about "infrastructure as code," we mean that we manage our IT infrastructure with code or configuration files.

With IaC, configuration files are made that describe our infrastructure. This makes it easier to change and share configurations.Â An IaC process produces the same environment every time it deploys, just as the same source code always generates the same binary.

## The difficulty of manually managing infrastructure

Managing IT infrastructure was traditionally a manual process where deployment team would physically install and configure servers.
