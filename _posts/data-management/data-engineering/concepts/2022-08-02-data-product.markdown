We live in a world full of data, but how can we best use it? It should come as no surprise that, when used wisely, *data is the most precious thing on the planet*.

Be aware that a data product is not the same as data as a product. We may hear the term "data as a product" often these days. One of the principles of the data mesh paradigm is to consider data as a product. This principle is sometimes shortened to "data products," which leads to a misunderstanding between data products and data as a product. 

Let's explore the distinctions between these two notions.

# What is a data product?
Any product is called a *data product* if data is the key enabler for its primary goal. This means that any digital product or feature that *relies on data* to achieve its ultimate purpose or goal may be referred to as a data product.

The former chief data scientist of the United States, DJ Patil, defined a data product in his 2012 book Data Jujitsu: The Art of Turning Data into Product as "*a product that facilitates an end goal though the use of data.*"

In general, a data product is any tool or application that processes data and produces outcomes. These outcomes may provide businesses with valuable insights.

## Various types of data products 
Typically, data products are categorized by type:

- Raw data
- Derived data
- Algorithms
- Insights (Decision support)
- Automated decision-making

## Examples of data products
Examples of data products are:
- Any online shopping page may be a data product if the featured products are dynamically displayed depending on my previous purchases and searches.
- Google analytics is a data product since the insights it presents to the end user are derived from data.
- A data warehouse - This data product is a mix of raw data, derived data and insights.
- A self-driving car - It's of the type automated decision-making. 

## What value does it provide?
Data products can help organisations extract insight from their data in order to develop more accurate forecasts, reduce expenses, and increase revenue.

# Data as a product
Data as a product. In other words, data as a first-class product. This implies that *data is considered as a true product*, as opposed to a by-product.

> The data referred to is organizational **shared data**, which is often shared across several users or applications while preserving data integrity for all entities consuming the data.

Our goal is to make the domain's shared data *discoverable*, *addressable*, *trustworthy*, and *secure* so other teams can make good use of it. In other words, we consider the other teams to be our internal customers of our data, and we take on increased stewardship responsibilities for our data.
