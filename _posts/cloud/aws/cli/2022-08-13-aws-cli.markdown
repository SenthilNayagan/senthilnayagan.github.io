# AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open-source tool that allows us to interact with AWS services (S3, EC2, etc.) using commands in our command-line shell. It's an interface between users and AWS services. The AWS CLI lets us start running commands that do the same things as the browser-based AWS Management Console from the command prompt in our terminal application with minimal configuration. The AWS CLI provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.

## AWS CLI version 2

The AWS CLI version 2 is the most current major version and supports all of the most recent features. Some features included in version 2 are not backported to version 1, and we must update to use them.

> **Note:** The AWS CLI version 2 is only available as a packaged installer. While it may be available via package managers, these are unsupported and unofficial packages that are not produced or maintained by AWS.

To install the AWS CLI version 2, refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html){:target="_blank"}.

Use the following command to verify the currently installed version:

```shell
aws --version
```

## How to configure AWS CLI to interact with AWS services?

Let's take a look at how to quickly configure the basic settings that the AWS CLI uses to interact with AWS. In general, the `aws configure` command is the quickest approach to get our AWS CLI installation up and running.

When we enter this (`aws configure`) command with no arguments, the AWS CLI prompts us for four pieces of information:

- Access key ID
- Secret access key
- AWS Region
- Output format

The AWS CLI stores sensitive credential information that we specify with `aws configure` command in a local file named `credentials`, in a folder named `.aws` in our home directory-the default location is `~/.aws/credentials`. 

Here is how we configure the AWS CLI to connect to our AWS account. These are only sample values. Replace them with our own values.

```shell
% aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIA4S2AHSC2UKNSQCFM
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: TCORDiSPQ5o4B7+SGerdEud1wZHQEQ7N0zhbX7m9
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

The AWS CLI stores the given details in a *profile* named `[default]` in the `credentials` file as shown below: 

```shell
% cat ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA4S2AHSC2UKNSQCFM
aws_secret_access_key = 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
```

Each profile is a collection of settings that include *access key id*, *secret access key*, etc. By default, when we run an AWS CLI command that doesn't say which profile to use, the information in the `[default]` profile is used.


### Multiple AWS accounts

If we have multiple AWS accounts to connect using AWS CLI, we may use the `â€”-profile` parameter to create a named profile. A profile is a collection of settings that include *access key id*, *secret access key*, etc. By default, the AWS CLI uses the `[default]` profile.

We can then specify a `--profile profilename` and use the credentials and settings stored under that name.

The following example creates a profile named `guestuser`:

```shell
aws configure --profile guestuser
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: text
```

### How to update existing settings?

To update these settings, run `aws configure` again (with or without the `--profile` parameter, depending on which profile we want to update) and enter new values as appropriate.
