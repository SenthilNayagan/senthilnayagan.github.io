# AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open source tool that allows us to interact with AWS services (S3, EC2, etc.) using commands in our command-line shell. It's an interface between users and AWS services. The AWS CLI lets us start running commands that do the same things as the browser-based AWS Management Console from the command prompt in our terminal application with minimal configuration. The AWS CLI provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.

## AWS CLI version 2

The AWS CLI version 2 is the most current major version and supports all of the most recent features. Some features included in version 2 are not backported to version 1, and we must update to use them.

> **Note:** The AWS CLI version 2 is only available as a packaged installer. While it may be available via package managers, these are unsupported and unofficial packages that are not produced or maintained by AWS.
