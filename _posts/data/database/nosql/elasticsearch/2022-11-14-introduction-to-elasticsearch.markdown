# Overview

Elasticsearch is the core of the Elastic Stack. It's a *distributed* search and analytics engine. 

# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## What is Elastic APM?

APM stands for application performance monitoring. APM is one of the most common methods engineers use today to measure the *availability*, *response times*, and *behavior of applications and services*.

Elastic APM, on the other hand, is an application performance monitoring system that is built on top of the ELK Stack (**Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, **Kibana**, and **Beats**). Like other APM solutions, Elastic APM allows us to track key performance related information such as requests, responses, database transactions, errors, etc.

The Elastic APM solution is made up of four building blocks:

- Elasticsearch for data storage and indexing
- Kibana for analyzing and visualizing the data
- APM server
- APM agent
