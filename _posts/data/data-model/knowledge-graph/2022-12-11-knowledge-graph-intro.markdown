# Overview

A knowledge graph is a network of real-world entities, such as objects, events, situations, or ideas, and shows how they are related. Most of the time, this information is kept in a graph database and viewed as a graph structure. This is where the term "knowledge graph" comes from.

There are three main components that make up a knowledge graph:

- **Nodes**
- **Edges**
- **Lables**

Any object, place, or person can be a node. An edge defines the relationship between the nodes. Having said that knowledge graphs focus on data that is connected.

# Why knowledge graph?

A **knowledge graph turns our data into knowledge** that a machine can understand. In other words, converting our data into machine-understandable knowledge. Its only purpose is to find hidden insights; it doesn’t serve operational purposes.

# Knowledge graph vs. relational database

## Purpose or goal

The goal of a knowledge graph is to uncover hidden insights; it doesn’t serve operational purposes. However, a relational database serves both operational and analytics purposes.

## Storage

In a knowledge graph, entities and relationships are stored as nodes and edges, respectively, while in a relational database, data is stored in tables as rows and columns. Join queries are used to establish the relationships between the tables. 

## Schema

Knowledge graphs are schema-free and unstructured, while relational databases have strict schemas. The structure and format of the data are predefined.

## Performance

Knowledge graphs are lightning fast, even for big data sets. Relational databases are relatively slower than knowledge graphs.

## Maintenance

Knowledge graphs are much easier because they don't have a schema. Relational databases are hard and often cumbersome because small changes can affect the whole structure.
