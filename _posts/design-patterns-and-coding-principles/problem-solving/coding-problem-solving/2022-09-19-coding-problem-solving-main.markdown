# Overview

Having a talent for finding solutions to problems may accelerate our performance and put us ahead of our contemporaries or colleagues. In general, the solutions to certain problems may be accomplished in the blink of an eye, while others might take much more time, even days. As a result, it is essential to approach the programming problems in the appropriate manner in order to save time and effort. Let's not attempt to solve the problem by using a **brute-force** approach.

Let's try different ways to solve each problem, from brute force to finding the most efficient solution.  

# Problems and solutions

## Problem 1: Find pair that sums up to "k"

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, create a boolean function that checks if there are two elements in `nums` such that we get `k` when we add them together.

## Problem 2: Find first repeating character in a given string

Given a string `str`, create a function that returns the first repeating character. If such character doesn't exist, return the null character `'\0'`.

# Conclusion

In my opinion, solutions that are straightforward and simple are preferable to those that use the newest buzzword technology. Let's not get too excited about new products before discovering if they are flexible, useful, and have any adverse effects.
