# Dear Hathway: I don't want to continue making monthly payments for an AMC plan, which you want to take from me "covertly" !

Just to give you a brief background on **Hathway**, it is one of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in India, offering high-speed broadband services across many cities.

## My recent unpleasant encounter with Hathway!

I am one of the Hathway broadband customers, and I've been using Hathway for approximately ten months now. I just noticed that a small amount is being collected from my monthly bill without my consent under the guise of **"Prepared Monthly AMC Plan for DCM-CPE Charges."**

As I mentioned, I have been using this broadband service for a while, and it wasn't like this before. From last month onward, I started to see that they had begun to collect this sum. I googled it and found that Hathway has not been doing it recently, but their customers have been reporting the same problem since 2018.

When I asked the customer service representatives about this, they responded that it's similar to the "corpus" amount Hathway takes from customers so that they can repair or replace the router in the event that it is physically damaged. Well, I get their intention, but why didn't Hathaway let their customers know about this and give them the choice of taking it or not? This is something we, as customers, have to decide, not Hathyway.

> What's the likely chance of returning this collected money in case the customer terminates the contract or connection for any reason and there isn't a need to use it to fix their router issue? 

This might not be a major deal given the small sum that is being collected each month, but the lack of transparency between Hathyway and its customers is a big deal!

I no longer desire to choose or pay for this AMC plan on a monthly basis. If this is the way Hathway works without being transparent with its customers, I am happy to terminate my connection and look for other providers.

I have reported this matter (sent an email to customer service and tweeted about it) and also opened a ticket with them to opt out of this so-called AMC plan.

## Leason learned!

In this digital world, a great deal of action just goes unnoticed and unperceived by us. When we choose to participate in anything, be sure to thoroughly read any contracts or agreements before signing them. Most importantly, we must periodically check to see how they (with whom we signed) are acting in accordance with the terms of our original agreement.
