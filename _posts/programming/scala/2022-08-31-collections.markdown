# Introduction to collections

A collection is an object in programming that *groups multiple elements into a single unit*. It's comparable to a container that can hold various items. A collection has an underlying data structure that is used to *store*, *manipulate*, and *retrieve* aggregate data in an *efficient manner*. When collections are used, readability and maintenance of the code are enhanced.

# Collections in Scala

Scala has a very rich collections library, located under the `scala.collection` package. There are two types of collections in Scala:

- **Mutable collections**
- **Immutable collections**

All collection classes are found in the following packages:

- `scala.collection`
- `scala.collection.immutable`
- `scala.collection.mutable`

> **Scala collections vs Java collections:** Scala collections are notably distinct from Java collections. For example, the Scala `List` class differs significantly from the Java `List` class, including the immutable nature of the Scala `List`.

## Mutable collections

A mutable collection can be *modified* or *extended* in place. This means that we can modify, add, or remove elements from a collection *with side effects*. All mutable collection classes are present in the `scala.collection.mutable` package.

## Immutable collections

In contrast, immutable collections *never change*. There are still operations that simulate additions, deletions, and updates, but each of these operations *returns a new collection and leaves the original collection unchanged*. All immutable collections are present under `scala.collection.immutable`. 

The collections in `scala.collection` are supertypes of `scala.collection.mutable` and `scala.collection.immutable`. The base operations are added to the types in the `scala.collection` package, while the immutable and mutable operations are added to the types in the other two packages.

# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## What is "InPlace" transformation operation?

Instead of *always returning a new collection* after a `map` or `filter` operation, mutable collections have a couple of new operations (`filterInPlace` and `mapInPlace`) that let us *change the elements right where they are* (in-place). These new operations *change the source collection*.

```scala
val buf1 = ArrayBuffer(0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)
buf1.filterInPlace(_ % 2 == 0) 
buf1 // ArrayBuffer(0, 2, 6, 8)

val buf2 = ArrayBuffer(0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)
buf2.mapInPlace(_ * 2)
buf2 // ArrayBuffer(0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18)
```

## What are *transformer* methods?

Transformer methods are collection methods that transform an input collection into a new output collection based on an algorithm we provide. 

Note that these transformations create copies of the collection while leaving the original untouched. This implies that if the original array is still in use, its contents will not be affected by the transform.

The transformer methods are as follows:

- `map`
- `filter`
- `reverse`

## What is collection buffer?

Buffers are used to create *sequences of elements* incrementally by appending, prepending, or inserting new elements. A buffer *can grow and shrink*. Having said that, buffers are *mutable*. 

Scala has buffers such as: 

- `ArrayBuffer` 
- `ListBuffer`

## What is collection builder?

A builder is a simplified form of a `Buffer` that is limited to generating its assigned collection type and only performing append operations. This is most useful for constructing immutable collections where we cannot add or remove elements once the collection has been constructed.

To construct a builder for a certain collection type, use the type's `newBuilder` method and pass in the element type as shown below. Invoke the builderâ€™s `result` method to convert it back into the final type (in this case `Array`).

```bash
$ val af = Array.newBuilder[Int]
af: collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder[Int] = ArrayBuilder.ofInt

$ af += 4
$ af += 7
$ af.result
res1: Array[Int] = Array(4, 7)
```

### Builder vs buffer (TODO)

**Difference 1:** Unlike with buffers, a builder knows its immutable counterpart:

Lets first construct an array collection using builder:

```bash
$ val af = Array.newBuilder[Int]
af: collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder[Int] = ArrayBuilder.ofInt
```

Now, let's the know the type of the collection using `getClass()` method. The type shows below is a mutable one.

```bash
$ af.getClass
res1: Class[T] = class scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder$ofInt
```

Let's append a value and see the type again:

```bash
$ af += 6
res2: collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder[Int] = ArrayBuilder.ofInt

$ af.getClass
res3: Class[T] = class scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder$ofInt 
```

Now, let's freeze the collection using `result` method and check the type again. <mark>Type is implicitly converted to its immutable counterpart.</mark>

```bash
$ af.result

$ af.getClass
res68: Class[T] = class scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder$ofInt
```

## What is persistent data structure?

A persistent data structure, also known as a *non-ephemeral* data structure, is a data structure that always preserves its prior state when it is updated. These data structures are essentially immutable, since their operations do not alter the structure in-place, but rather always result in a new structure that has been modified. Having said that, all immutable data structures or collections are all persistent.

Consider the following examples. I have used ammonite REPL to demostrate persistent data structure. Therefore, it displays the '@' prefix. We created a list of numbers and used a `filter` method to choose just the even elements. As seen in the example below, the updated list produces a new list named `res142`. It does not update the original list - we checked the same by printing the original list.

```bash
@ val numSeq: List[Int] = List(10, 7, 21, 8, 3, 17)
numSeq: List[Int] = List(10, 7, 21, 8, 3, 17)

@ numSeq.filter(_ % 2 == 0)
res142: List[Int] = List(10, 8)

@ print(numSeq)
List(10, 7, 21, 8, 3, 17)
```

## What are the benefits of using Vector in Scala over List or other data structures?

Vector is an immutable data structure introduced in version 2.8 of the Scala to address the inefficiencies of random access in other existing data structures. Vector is a persistent data structure using **structural sharing**. Random access is much better with vector, especially when the collection is big.

### Implemention

Vector extends `AbstractSeq` and `IndexedSeq`, thus it provides constant-time (`O(1)`):

- Element access
- Lenght computation

Vector is currently the default implementation of immutable `IndexedSeq`. Vector is implemented as a base-32 integer trie. There are `0` to `32` (`2`<sup>`5`</sup>) nodes at the root level, and there can be another `32` nodes connecting to each node at the root level. Thus, the second level can accommodate a maximum of `32*32` (`2`<sup>`10`</sup>) elements. Similarly, the third level will have  `32*32*32` (`2`<sup>`15`</sup>) elements, so and so forth. Thus, a Vector of five levels can hold up to `2`<sup>`30`</sup> elements. Accessing items from such a large collection requires traversing just five layers of nodes, making the process effectively constant time.

### Performance

For head access and iteration algorithms, a linear sequence collection will provide a little advantage over an indexed sequence. For all other purposes, an indexed sequence will perform much quicker, particularly in large collections.

#### Prepend and append 

As stated above, Vector is a persistent data structure using *structural sharing*. This method makes the append/prepend process almost as quick as any mutable data structure. When a new element is added by appending or prepending, the structure is modified via structure sharing and a new Vector is returned.

#### Random access and random updates

When it comes to random access and random updates, Vector excels in comparison to all other immutable collections. Due to its implementation of a trie data structure, accessing an element at any place in the tree involves traversing just a few levels and branches.

#### Head and tail access

Head and tail element access is a further common procedure. As expected, accessing the beginning and end elements of an indexed tree data structure is a quick process. Note that `tail` command returns an iterable that contains all the elements without the first element.

#### Iteration

Some algorithms need iterating over all collection components. Although traversing all of a Vector's elements is somewhat more complex than traversing a linked list.

## What is trie data structure?

Trie (to be pronounced as "try") is an ordered tree data structure used for *storing* and *searching* a specific key from a set. A trie is also called a *digital tree* or *prefix tree*, which is a type of *k-ary* search tree. These keys are most often strings.

> **k-ary tree:** An m-ary tree (also known as **n-ary**, **k-ary**, or **k-way** tree) is a rooted tree in graph theory in which each node has no more than `m` children. For example, a **binary tree** has a max of 2 children (m = 2), and a **ternary tree** is another case with m = 3, which limits its children to three.
 
## What is identity function?

An identity function is a basic function that takes one argument and the only thing it does is return the same argument value, unchanged i.e., `f(x) = x`. In other words, it's a function in which the output is the same as the input. The identity function is also known as an *identity map* or *identity relation*.
 
Just like zero is a neutral value for additions, an identity function is a nuetral value for higher-order-functions.
