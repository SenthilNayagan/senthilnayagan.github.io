## What is an anti-pattern?
The term "anti-pattern" was first used in 1995 by a computer programmer, Andrew Koenig, in an article called "Journal of Object-Oriented Programming."

Anti-patterns in software engineering are a commonly used, simple-to-implement solution to recurring issues that is often inefficient and has the potential of being incredibly counterproductive. It demonstrates how to go from a problem to a bad solution. We just call these bad ideas.

Although they first seem to be quick and reasonable, anti-patterns typically have adverse effects in the future. We will eventually come to understand that anti-pattern results in more negative outcomes than positive ones.

A well formulated anti-pattern reveals us:

- Why does the poor solution seem appealing?
- Why it ends up being bad?
- What best patterns are available to replace it?

> The issue that the anti-pattern is attempting to solve already has a better alternative solution in place that is proven to be effective in contrast to the anti-pattern.

Keep in mind that the same solution act as both a pattern and an anti-pattern depending on the situation.
