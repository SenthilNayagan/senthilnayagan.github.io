rbenv commands:
rbenv install -l - List all versions of Ruby available, but aren't installed yet in our machine
rbenv versions - List of the Ruby versions already installed on our machine
rbenv version - Shows the current version of Ruby

Global version numbers are stored in: ~/.rbenv/versions/

Set the latest version of ruby to be the default version of ruby:
rbenv global <version>

GitHub for static site generators:
GitHub Pages will use Jekyll to build your site by default. If you want to use a static site generator 
other than Jekyll, disable the Jekyll build process by creating an empty file called .nojekyll in 
the root of your publishing source.

GitHub Pages does not support server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python.
